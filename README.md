# LaTex-Paramedic

This a relatively simple Python progrom which reads a LaTex (.tex) file and 
outputs modified version with some textcoloring and underlining based on the 
Paramedic Method  (originally developed by Richard Lanham in Revising Prose) of editing writing.
See https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/635/01/ for one version and explanation of the approach.
